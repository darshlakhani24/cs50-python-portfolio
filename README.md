# CS50P Portfolio — Darsh Lakhani

This repository contains my submissions for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python, including problem sets and my final project. It documents my progression from foundational Python concepts to building a complete, tested command-line application.

## Course Overview

CS50P is a rigorous introduction to programming using Python, with an emphasis on:
- Computational thinking and problem solving
- Writing clean, readable, and correct Python code
- Using functions, conditionals, loops, and data structures effectively
- Testing and validating programs

This portfolio reflects my engagement with the course material and my development as a Python programmer.
